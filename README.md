## What is GCPL?

GCPL is a *nix shell script that updates your Linux Praat version from the [UvA website](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/download_linux.html). It is written with Linux in mind, but may be adapted for use on Mac's (easy) or Windows machines (somewhat harder).

## How to use the hack --- er, rather, the _script_.

Download the script file to your Praat directory (the one containing the `praat` executable). Run the script with `bash GetCurrentPraat_Linux.sh` . Et Voil√†!
